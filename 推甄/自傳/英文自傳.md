I'm Ian, a student, a technology enthusiast, and JavaScript Lover.

- Born in Taipei city

Moreover, I'm interested in computer science since I was 13.

when I was in junior school, I get my first smartphone, which model is HTC Wildfire, and which clock rate of CPU has only 528 Mhz.

That means: Even if I wanna play a simple game just like: angry bird, this smartphone also can't bring good user experience to me.

So, I'm started to reading stories, that talking about: unlock bootlater, Root, Overclock, Install custom ROM on your phone, in xda development for getting improvement.

Besides, I set up my first website based on WordPress and started learning programming languages when I was 17.

In college, I'm trying to learn more popular programming languages, e.g., Python, C++, JavaScript, PHP.

In most programming languages, JavaScirpt is my favorite, that can be used to build web-applications, server applications, applications on IOS, Android, Windows, Linux... and so on, or even create your Own Command-line-interface tool.

Last but not least, I'm keen to join any competition, workshop, conference, meetup about computer science to make me better and expand my horizons.
